# MLalloyproject
Machine learning regression models used for model prediction of material properties from composition

A composition search space is created where alloy composition is varied for 4 elements in each row. The ML model is then used to predict the properties of all compositions in he search space.

The aim is to find a composition that will have better properties than present in the original database
